Simply Better
==================
This is a custom Pelican theme based off of the `simple` theme that Pelican
comes with and [Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
It is minimal and does not come with the
typical features a blog might have (e.g. categories, archive), which you can
add yourself.

It also features the Merriweather and Open Sans fonts from Google
Web Fonts.

See this theme in action at my blog:

Pelican Settings Used
