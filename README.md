Simply Better
==================
This is a custom Pelican theme based off of the simple theme that Pelican
comes with and Twitter's Bootstrap. It is minimal and does not come with the 
typical features a blog might have (e.g. categories, archive). It also features the Merriweather font from Google
Web Fonts. 
The theme is flexible enough so you can add your own features yourself.
